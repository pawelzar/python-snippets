## About
These are some programming exercises with my own solutions, which I find interesting and worth of showing. Most of these issues are short, but encouraged me to learn new things about Python and learn some clever approaches to solve problems (especially when the case is code golf).

## Credits
Most of the tasks come from [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/b537e4e78f44fe5c659ad1737201c01f7716321), which I highly recommend if you want to prove your skills against other programmers in some coding games or just want to have fun when writing code. The games introduced there will often push you to learn some language specific tricks, which you may not have known before.
