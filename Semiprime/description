A Semi-Prime is a number that is the product of two (not necessarily different) prime numbers P and Q.
Remember that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

For instance:
15 = 3 × 5 is a Semi-Prime
9 = 3 × 3 is a Semi-Prime
28 = 2 × 2 × 7 is not a Semi-Prime

You must print all the integers in a list that are Semi-Primes.
Input
Line 1:N the number of items in the list
Next N lines: Each item Xi of the list
Output
One line for each Semi-Prime in the list, in order of appearance.
Constraints
N ≤ 40
P,Q < 5000
Xi < 10000
