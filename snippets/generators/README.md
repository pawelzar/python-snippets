# Generators

These are some generators which I've created to gain more fluency.

### DEFINITION:

To simplify, a generator is like a normal loop with a significant difference that it stops after every iteration and it generates an element on demand.

### PROFITS:

Let's assume we have a file with 1000000 lines but we only need first 5. Do we have to read the whole file and after that get only the lines we want?

We can make the process faster and use less memory using generator which will read line by line and stop after getting what we need. This is just an example usage.
