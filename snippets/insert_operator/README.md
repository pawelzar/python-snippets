# Insert correct operator

Your program must insert the correct operator (+, -, / or *) at the right index of an integer number N so that the resulting operation equals a given integer X.

The operation is always valid and the result is always an integer. Plus '+' and minus '-' are the only operators that can be inserted at index 0.

In each test, there is only one possible solution.

### INPUT:

An integer N and an integer X, separated by spaces.

### OUTPUT:

N with an operator +, -, * or / inserted between the letters so that the resulting operation equals X.

### EXAMPLE:

Input

```
3034 64
```

Output

```
30+34
```
